============================

Your team's Phase II grade is based on this scale:

    http://www.artsandscience.utoronto.ca/ofr/calendar/rules.htm#grading

The way we graded is as follows: your team starts with an A+. When errors and
problems are found, you will lose 0, 1, 2, or 3 letter steps, depending on the
severity. As an example, if you lost two steps, your team would earn an A-:

     A+ -> A
     A -> A-

==== Product and Sprint backlogs ==== [up to -6]

Mark: 0

Mark deductions: None

==== Java Style ==== [not counted in mark]

Mark: -0.5

Mark deductions:
- Many methods don't follow camelCase (-0.5)

Other comments:
- Packages should be lower case.

==== Design ==== [not counted in mark]

Mark: -1.5

Mark deductions:
- (Same as 2A) JShell's main method is far too long. You should shorten this by use of a hash table to store command strings and appropriate classes to handle all of your command code. (-1)

- (Same as 2A) It is too hard to add new commands. You must manually add it to the man command and to a messy if statement in JShell. Consider using a hash table and reflection instead. (-0.5)

==== Javadoc ==== [not counted in mark]

Mark: -2

Mark deductions:
- No Javadoc on some classes (-0.5)
- No Javadoc on some variables (-0.5)
- Many methods don't have Javadoc. (-1)

==== Testing ==== [up to -6] 

Mark: -2

Mark deductions:
- This is not how you set up test cases. You must use JUnit as was discussed in class. (-2)

==== Correctness ==== [up to -6]

Mark: -5

Mark deductions:
- "ls" crashes when given invalid input (-0.5)
- "ls" on files and -R do not work (-0.5)
- "mkdir" does not create directories (-1)
- "!number" is not implemented (-1)
- IO Redirection for commands other than echo does not work (-1)

Test cases:
  The weighing of test cases are done in the following way:
    70% for Assignment2B test cases (27 test cases are 2B)
    30% for Assignment2A test cases (13 test cases are 2A)
  Every 0.08 deduction in failed test cases amounts to one deduction.

Failed test cases (((1/13 * 0.3) + (2/27 * 0.7)) / 0.08 = 1):
1) Invalid Echo (2A)
	> echo “” >> test > test2
	Expected: Then the last command should just throw an error.
	Actual: Creates test2.
	
2) Renaming a file (2B)
	> mv github.txt git.txt
	> cat git.txt
	Expected: Removes github.txt and creates git.txt.
	Actual: InvalidDirectoryPath error
	
3) Copying a file (2B)
	> cp github.txt git.txt
	Expected: Should keep github.txt and create git.txt
	Actual: Throws an error.
